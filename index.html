                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    Born and raised in Jerusalem, Israel, Cohen enrolled at Tel Aviv University after secondary school in the Engineering program. It was during this time she did a semester abroad at Boston University. After college, she enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces. Her engineering background made her a great candidate for mechanical maintenance and demolitions.
                    <p>She was later transferred to FBI SWAT due to an international law enforcement exchange program. Cohen brought her knowledge of demolitions with her in producing a weapon-mounted breach charge capable of blowing open a door or wall from a distance.</p>
                    <p><h3>Phychological Profile</h3></p>
                    <p>Her military training as a demolitions specialist has left Cohen with an inflated sense of self. She can be aggressive, impulsive, and overly confident. She is quick to action, which can be an asset or fatal for someone in her line of work.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    Kessikbayev grew up in a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. After his family emigrated to Russia shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kessikbayev followed in his father's footsteps and enrolled in the military, where his facility with technology landed him a spot in the coveted weapon testing brigade at Alabino firing range near Moscow.
                    <p><h3>Phychological Profile</h3></p>
                    <p>Kessikbayev is an expert tinkerer and a master craftsman, more at ease with the workings of machines than those of people. His gruff demeanor and curt speech should not be mistaken for misanthropy. He possesses a strong moral conviction.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    In school, Nizan excelled at athletics specifically in Track and Field. The youngest son of a working-class family, he enlisted in the Gendarmerie Nationale at eighteen and found himself assigned to the Highway Patrol unit.

His skill with a rifle eventually attracted the attention of the GIGN.
                    <p><h3>Phychological Profile</h3></p>
                    <p>Nizan is idealistic and trusting. He can be impulsive and must self-regulate in order to remain on task. When his focus is clear, he is decisive and driven to complete the task at hand.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    Raised by his uncle who was a mechanic for what later became the Bundespolizei (BPOL) Aviation Group after reunification, Streicher joined BPOL as a helicopter technician. He began designing defensive weapon systems, including a ground-based Active Defense System (ADS) prototype that caught the attention of the GSG-9. A veteran of the GSG-9 anti-piracy ops in the Indian Ocean, he was later recruited to Team Rainbow.
                    <p><h3>Phychological Profile</h3></p>
                    <p>Streicher is highly creative and curious, with a strong desire to serve. He has a tendency to lack humility. Though he has a remarkable affinity for complex machinery, he is not adept at reading social cues. Coupled with his boisterous tendencies he can be a bit abrasive.</p>
